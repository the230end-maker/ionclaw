## What is IonClaw?

IonClaw is an AI agent orchestrator built from the ground up in C++. One codebase, compiled natively for each platform — no runtime, no interpreter, no container required.

On a server (Linux, macOS, Windows), it starts with one command and serves a full web panel. On iOS, Android, tvOS, and watchOS, the app embeds the same C++ engine and runs everything locally on the device. **It is the only AI agent orchestrator that runs on mobile** — a true personal assistant, with **privacy and security by design**, because it runs on your device. Same codebase, same capabilities, everywhere.

### Why C++?

Because native means fast startup, low memory, no dependencies, and true portability. The entire platform — web panel, project templates, built-in skills — is compiled into the binary. You deploy one file and it just works.

### What can it do?

- **Multi-agent** — run multiple agents with independent models, tools, and workspaces
- **Real-time task board** — track every agent task live, with full history and status
- **Web control panel** — configure agents, providers, credentials, and skills from the browser
- **Skills system** — extend agent capabilities with simple Markdown files
- **Browser automation** — agents can navigate, click, type, screenshot, and extract data from web pages
- **Multi-provider** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Kimi, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Scheduler** — cron expressions, intervals, and one-shot tasks with full board tracking
- **Subagents** — agents can spawn child agents for parallel work
- **Memory** — persistent memory with search-based recall across sessions
- **File management** — read, write, search, and organize files within sandboxed workspaces
- **MCP Server** — expose agents via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for use with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other MCP clients
- **MCP Client** — connect to external [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers to use their tools and resources
- **Secure** — sandboxed workspaces, JWT auth, tool policy per agent, hook system for custom rules

## Screenshots

See [screenshots](docs/screenshots.md) for some platforms running IonClaw.

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** CMake 3.20+, C++17 compiler, Node.js 18+ (for web client).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionclaw-org/ionclaw.git
cd ionclaw

make setup-web
make build-web
make build
make install
```

Then initialize and start a project:

```bash
ionclaw-server init /path/to/your/project
ionclaw-server start --project /path/to/your/project
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The web panel is served automatically.
